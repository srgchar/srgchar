Greetings,

I am Sergej, a Biotechnology specialist with expertise in Data Analysis. 
While I am unable to publicly disclose my research findings, I am keen to share my valuable experiences from Turing College.
During my time there, I acquired a wealth of knowledge in data analytics, mastering various techniques and methodologies. 
Though the number of projects may be modest, I am committed to continuously enhancing my skills, ensuring that this repository will expand over time.

I hope you find value in my projects. Thank you for your interest. :)
